# The Skeleton Plane
## Wireframe mockups
I initially utilised Canva to produce wireframes of how the app would appear across different devices. The colors from the canvas are different from those in the application but the skeleton remained the same.

## The Surface Plane

### Design

The design of this app it was thought as simple and precise as possible, to make it easy for the user, for kids.

### Colour Scheme

The default color scheme was inspired from mycolor.space. It can be found [here](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23374E78&sub=1).

### Typography

Google fonts was utilised to find a font that would be clean and clear for all users, whilst still conveying an element of fun. I eventually settled on 'Roboto Mono', monospace font.
