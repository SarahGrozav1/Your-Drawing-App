# The Skeleton Plane
## Wireframe mockups
I initially utilised Canva to produce wireframes of how the app would appear across different devices. The colors from the canvas are different from those in the application but the skeleton remained the same.

## The Surface Plane

### Design

The design of this app it was thought as simple and precise as possible, to make it easy for the user, for kids.

### Colour Scheme

The default color scheme was inspired from mycolor.space. It can be found [here](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23374E78&sub=1).

### Typography

Google fonts was utilised to find a font that would be clean and clear for all users, whilst still conveying an element of fun. I eventually settled on 'Roboto Mono', monospace font.

## Features

> Home Page 

The home page is the page of the site that the user is greeted by when they first visit. Here the user will have a header and bellow two buttons. One to start drawing and one with a popup intructions. Also a text with a quote is there and a cube with colorful hover effect. And the last one its a footer with a text "This it's an app just for educantional purposes".

## Future Enhancements

> Eraser

 It would be nice to include an eraser so that the user could eras only the desired lines.

 > Geometric figures

 If the user want to draw some geometric figures with sraight lines it could help him some geometric figures already there , he would need just to drag them in the canva and make the desired size.

 > Straight Line

 If the user want to make straight line, he could use the straight line from the tools bar that could help him to create what he wants.

 > 3D line

 A 3D line would be fun for the user to use.

 > Neon and glitter colors

 Adding neon colors and glittered colors that would shine the user would have more options and fun.

There is one notable bug and this is about cursor start point. So, when it's drawing the line it's under the mouse about one ich.

## Deployment & Development

### Version Control

The site was created using the VS Code editor.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Deployment

The website was deployed using GitHub Pages by following these steps:

1. In the GitHub respository navigate to the Settings tab.
2. Select Pages from the menu on the left-hand side of the page.
3. For the source select Branch: 'main' and then select: 'save'.
4. After the webpage refreshes automatically a ribbon at the top will displays the following message: "Your site is live at "

The website repository can be forked by the following steps:

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Click on the Fork button in the upper right hand corner.

The repository can be cloned by the following steps:

1. Got to the GitHub repository.
2. Locade the Code button above the list of files and click on it.
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard ($ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY)
